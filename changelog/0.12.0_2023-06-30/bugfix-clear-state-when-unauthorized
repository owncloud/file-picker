Bugfix: Clear state when unauthorized

The filepicker now reacts to `401` responses by resetting the internal authentication state to `unauthorized`,
forcing the user to log in again.
This situation can happen when an access token that's not expired, yet, was invalidated server side (e.g. through
a backchannel logout or session inactivity) and would previously lead to a broken application state.
